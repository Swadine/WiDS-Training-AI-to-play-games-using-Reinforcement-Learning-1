# Winter of Data Science: Reinforcement Learning

This is the resources and code repository for the Winter of Data Science Project on playing games using Reinforcement Learning.

## Resources

We will mainly be following Sutton & Barto for the theoretical aspects of Reinforcement Learning and the book Grokking Reinforcement Learning by Miguel Morales for the implementation details.

## Tentative Schedule

- Week 1:
Quick introduction to Python and useful Python modules such as NumPy, MatPlotLib, TensorFlow/PyTorch, etc. Implementing a game of Snake in Python which we'll later use to train our model.

- Weeks 2 and 3:
Introduction to Reinforcement Learning from Sutton and Barto, and implementation of few basic algorithms. Using these to train an agent to play the game we made.

- Week 4:
Studying Deep Reinforcement Learning and improving our agaent.

- Weeks 5 and 6:
Implementing Agents to play Atari games from the paper: Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning by Mnih, Kavukcuoglu et al and from [the OpenAI Blog](https://openai.com/blog/gym-retro).
